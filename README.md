# twitter-controlled-laser
A twitterbot that sends an Arduino xy coordinates that it recieves from tweets. This was a project I undertook in Middle School.

This was built using an Adafruit Featherboard as a controller, with a NodeJS application sending it coordinates it gets from twitter.


I learned to use the twit library for javascript here:

I first got the idea for this project(as well as learned about serial communications with arduino) from here:

## THIS CODE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND WILL LIKELY NOT WORK WITH THE UPDATED VERSIONS OF THE LIBRARIES
